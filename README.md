# Mining the Twitter Network of US Congressmen

The project scrapes lists of friends and followers of US Congressmen (as of 2017) and calculates their ideological positions using Correspondence Analysis.

See https://twitter.com/cspan/lists/members-of-congress/members for an updated list.

The design of this project refers to https://github.com/pablobarbera/twitter_ideology.
